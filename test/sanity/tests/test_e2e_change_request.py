"""Change request -> AWE approval -> applied change -> version history -> audit.

The flow under test:
  1. raise a change request on the sanity farmer via staff-portal-api;
  2. AWE starts a workflow from the register's bound approval policy;
  3. approve each stage through the **AWE proxy**;
  4. AWE posts an HMAC-signed decision webhook back to the registry;
  5. the registry applies the change and writes a history row;
  6. Audit Manager records the events.

Identity: the suite's OWN seeded user (sanity.keycloak_seed), logged in with the
password grant. The shipped demo users cannot be reused — keycloak-init gives
them a temporary password, so Keycloak forces UPDATE_PASSWORD and their password
grant fails. sanity.awe_seed therefore names the sanity user as an approver on
each stage of the shipped policy, additively, leaving the demo-user rules alone.
`forbid_self_approval` is FALSE on the shipped policy, so the one user both
raises the CR and clears every stage.

It never calls `/change-requests/approve_change_request`: that endpoint flips
the CR to approved **without inspecting the AWE workflow at all**, so approving
through it would make this test pass while proving nothing about the approval
policy. The only meaningful path is the AWE proxy.

AWE does not apply the decision itself — it POSTs an HMAC-signed webhook to the
registry, which applies the change and writes history. So the change lands
asynchronously and the assertions below poll rather than read once.
